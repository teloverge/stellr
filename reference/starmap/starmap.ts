// The star-map renderer: one coherent imperative canvas island behind a narrow
// seam — mount, receive the pushed model, emit selection — never decomposed into
// components (ADR 0010). The Svelte chrome hosts it but never reaches inside.
//
// Two guarantees the seam tests pin (spec, Testing Decisions):
//   1. Deterministic layout — the same ticket data always lays out the same way.
//   2. Zero star movement across the lifecycle — a model push changes a star's
//      appearance (its derived status) but never its position. Layout is
//      recomputed only when the map's *structure* (its tickets and edges)
//      changes; a pure status push keeps every position byte-for-byte.
//
// Rendering (the starfield, glow, pulse, easing) is the part that can only be
// judged by eye (starmap-design.md, Open risk), and it degrades gracefully: when
// no 2D context is available (a headless test), the island still ingests the
// model, holds deterministic positions, and emits selection — it simply draws
// nothing. That is what lets the seam be tested without a browser canvas.

  // whole line-height apart. Solving against a position that does not move makes
  // the answer identical every frame, so the stars breathe and the labels hold
  // still.

  // Greedy point-feature label placement. Three rules do the work:
  //
  //   1. Stars are obstacles, not just other labels. The old solver only ever
  //      tested a label against labels, so one pushed aside to dodge its
  //      neighbour would happily land on top of a star.
  //   2. A label can climb above the star, not only hang below it. Eight
  //      candidates over four distances on each side, ordered so the side the
  //      label last took is tried first and the other side has to beat it by
  //      SIDE_HYSTERESIS steps to win it over. Placement stays strictly vertical
  //      and always centred on its own star: a sideways slot would buy room in a
  //      cluster, but a label that drifts laterally reads as belonging to
  //      whichever star it drifted toward.
  //   3. A label that fits nowhere is dropped rather than drawn over something.
  //      Which is survivable only because placement runs in priority order, so
  //      what gets dropped is the dimmest star present, never the selected one.
  //
  // Cost is ~16·N² box tests for N visible stars, run once per camera pose (the
  // cache above), which at map scale is microseconds. An easing camera changes
  // pose every frame and so pays that every frame; the hysteresis rides along on
  // it for one map read and one map write per label, which is free by comparison.
