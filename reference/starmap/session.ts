// star, and how that state is derived from the pushed model.
//
// The base palette (theme.ts) is spent on the six derived statuses. chartr
// adds a second axis — a session's liveness — so the overlay is deliberately
// *not* more colour: the session is a **body**, an amber moon orbiting the star
// it holds (spec, stories 25–27). Liveness is the moon's motion.
//
// Every state carries a **non-colour channel** — motion or shape — so nothing
// here is colour-only. GRAMMAR is that promise written down: the renderer draws
// from it, and the seam test asserts the property over it.
