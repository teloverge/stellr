# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, including labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments` with appropriate label and state filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`.
- **Apply or remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`.
- **Close an issue**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`.

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically inside the clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.**

GitHub shares one number space across issues and pull requests. Resolve an ambiguous `#<number>` with `gh pr view <number>` and fall back to `gh issue view <number>`.

## Publishing

When a skill says to publish to the issue tracker, create a GitHub issue. When a skill says to fetch the relevant ticket, run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes, Decisions-so-far, and Fog body.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue using `gh api`. Where sub-issues are unavailable, add the child to a task list in the map body and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body. Labels are `wayfinder:research`, `wayfinder:prototype`, `wayfinder:grilling`, or `wayfinder:task`. Once claimed, assign the ticket to the driving developer.
- **Blocking**: use GitHub's native issue dependencies. Add an edge with `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`, where `<blocker-db-id>` is the blocker's numeric database ID. Where dependencies are unavailable, fall back to a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line at the top of the child body. A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children, drop those with an open blocker or an assignee, and take the first in map order.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`; this is the session's first tracker write.
- **Resolve**: comment with the answer, close the ticket, and append a context pointer containing its gist and link to the map's Decisions-so-far.
